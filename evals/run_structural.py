"""Structural evals for Council v2 — runnable without an LLM.

Verifies the framework is wired correctly: skills present, the Core contract intact, council-review
is a mode that rides the Core and proposes-then-confirms, council-init has the tailoring phases, and the
bootstrap re-injects after compaction. These are the invariants a build must never break.

Behavioral drills (does it actually catch a bug, tailor the roster, keep quiet when idle) require a
live Claude Code run — see behavioral-drills.md.
