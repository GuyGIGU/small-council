"""Helper evals for the Small Council — run bin/council against scaffolded git repos.

Needs bash and git; no LLM, no network. Covers:
  - the council home: main checkout, linked worktree, outside git;
  - runs: open, update, close; a second in-progress run on one tree refused without --alongside;
    commands that never guess between runs; paused runs; session ids; init creating the home; an old
    open run found behind many newer closed ones;
  - the change index: files, symbols (code only, shell functions included), callers, tests;
  - gates judged by exit code, with the command passed intact, and table cells that never shift;
  - seat-file collection: ref: proof of reading (paired seats too), caps, broken citations, list-style
    and unreadable index lines, failed and re-dispatched workers;
  - citation and origin checks; map status; the drift doctor.
