"""Zip a skill (SKILL.md + manifest.json + declared references) into a .skill package.

Usage: package_skill.py <skill_dir> <references_dir> <out_path.skill>

Reference bundling lives here in pure Python — NOT in a shell copy loop — on purpose. A bash loop
that reads a `python -c` reference list loses every entry except the last to CRLF translation on
Windows (`references/<ref>\r` matches no file), which silently ships packages missing their refs.
Doing the manifest read + copy in one process avoids that round-trip entirely.
